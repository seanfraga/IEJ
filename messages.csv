STOP. Your project requires IRB approval because it involves human subject research. Skip a turn while you figure out how to prepare an IRB application.
"""Current wait times for IRB review are three weeks and increasing. A reminder that ‘expedited review’ does not mean your proposal will be reviewed more quickly!” Remain in place."
“So your idea reminds me of something…” Coffee with a colleague in another discipline points you toward an interesting idea that you borrow for this project. Move forward 6 spaces.
